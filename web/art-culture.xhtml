        Art &amp; Culture
        Hong Kong Parkview is proud and honoured to host one of the city’s most diverse private art collections. 
        The collection is on display for the pleasure of members and visitors alike and has been collected by over 
        three generations of Hong Kong Parkview’s owning family. Spanning the Archaic Bronze Age, to Dynastic 
        Buddhistic scrolls and sculptures, to modern art, sculptures, paintings and ceramics, these pieces have 
        become an iconic and integral part of Hong Kong Parkview identity. You can visit these pieces throughout 
        the property and feel free to visit our Reading Room on the level 2.
